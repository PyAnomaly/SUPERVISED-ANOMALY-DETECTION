##### CLASSICAL TWO CLASS SVDD | KERNEL SVDD [CODE](https://github.com/PyAnomaly/SUPERVISED-ANOMALY-DETECTION/blob/master/TWO%20CLASS%20SVDD/twoClassSVDD.py)

##### In real life the target data set often contains more than one class of objects and each class of objects need to be described and distinguished simultaneously. Two class SVDD is an improved support vector data description method proposed to solve two class problem for novelty anomaly detection.
